# HTML and CSS Projects

This is a display of sample websites that I made using HTML and CSS.

## Projects

- [Travel Destination Site](https://mmfk20.github.io/Travel-Destination/)
- [Movie Showtimes Site](https://mmfk20.github.io/Bootstrap-Project-mohammad/)

### Travel Destination Site
This page is a simple website created for a travel destination. It's built using only HTML and CSS. The site features descriptive text, headings, and images organized into a clean layout.

### Movie Showtimes Site
This is a movie theater homepage created using Bootstrap 5. It includes Bootstrap components such as a navbar, showtime listings, responsive cards, and layout elements.
